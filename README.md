# simulation-builder.js
3D library in javascript to build a virtual experimental world.

This math was made before I was aware that matrices are a thing.
The algorithms are therefore based on trigonometry math to acheive the
representation of 3D structures using as a starting point only
a line-drawing function in javascript.
