# simulation-builder.js
3D library to build structures in a html5 canvas.

#Description
The library is based on non-matrix algorythms, rather on basic proportions and angle mathematics. The tasks it performs in the drawYourStructure branch
is drawing a sery of cubes on keyboard commands. The whole thing uses exclusively the moveTo() and drawTo() functions to draw lines. The math, probably
preexisting, was nonetheless found again by myslef. All of the algorythms in the project are of my creation.

#How to launch

To launch the program, simply click on the "download zip" button on the github page. Open the zip file, and moove the folder inside of the zip outside
in any other repository. Then, open the simulationjs folder, revealing a serie of file including the index.html file. Launch that file through a browser
by clicking on it or any other way.
